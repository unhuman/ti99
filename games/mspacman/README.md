# Ms. Pac-Man (`MSPAC`)

A from-scratch Ms. Pac-Man for XB256, built **incrementally** — see `DESIGN.md` (§12 is the step
roadmap). Sprites (Ms. Pac-Man, ghosts, fruit) at `CALL MAGNIFY(3)` (double-size, 4 chars each),
moved with `CALL LOCATE` (never `MOTION`), 1-char-thick walls, and `CALL LINK("FLICK")` sprite
rotation so >4 sprites on a line don't vanish. Replaces the broken `mspacman-old/`.

- **Source:** `src/MSPAC.ti99`
- **Current step:** **Step 3b — eating, score, win-on-clear** (on top of the Step 3a maze +
  movement). Press **Q** to quit.
- **Status:** awaiting interpreted run + compile.

## Step 3a — what you should see / test
The **authentic Ms. Pac-Man Maze 1** (the pink maze), drawn from a `DATA` grid occupying screen
rows 3–24 / cols 3–30 (rows 1–2 are reserved for the score/info HUD): **pink** thin (4px) walls
(mask-autotiled), **white dots** in the corridors, 4 corner **power pellets**, the **inset
"waist"** with **two tunnel pairs** (that wrap left↔right), and the central **ghost house**. HUD
`MAZE 1 DOTS 224`. **3 ghosts sit in the house with the red one (Blinky) on top of the gate**, the
cherry just below the house, and **Ms. Pac-Man** drives with **E/S/D/X** or **joystick 1** —
gliding, turning at cells, blocked by every wall, wrapping through either tunnel.
- **Source of truth:** `assets/maze1-arcade.txt` (the full 28×31 arcade layout, from
  shaunlebron/pacman-mazegen). The TI version collapses the doubled wall-rows (31→22 rows) to fit
  the 24-row screen — the *shape is preserved exactly*, only the vertical scale changes.
- **Verified** (offline flood-fill, straight from the encoded `DATA`): 224 dots+pellets, all 28
  wide, **0 unreachable**, every sprite on a legal cell.
- **Resolved (per review):** the dead-end stubs beside the ghost-house box now zigzag through to
  the corridor above (matching the arcade), the wall gaps above the top tunnel and the lower power
  pellets are closed, and the redundant inner wall row below the lower power pellets was collapsed
  out (22 rows total, freeing a screen row).
- **Resolved (per review):** the maze grid shifted down one more screen row (now rows 3–24),
  freeing a **2-row HUD strip** at the top for score/info; dots were cleared from the entire
  ghost-house box surround (above the gate, both flanking columns the full height of the box
  including the diagonal corners, and the row below the box) and the tunnel mouths were widened by
  one more cell on each side of both wrap-around rows — 262 → 224 dots+pellets.
- **Resolved (per review):** the ghost-house gate is now drawn as a **white horizontal door tile**
  (code 160, its own `COLOR2` set 17), and the wall-check (`GOSUB 700`) blocks Ms. Pac-Man from
  entering the door cells or the pen interior — the ghost box is now off-limits to the player.
- **Resolved (per review):** the pen's interior (DATA row 11, cols 12–17 — **6 cells wide**) is
  wider than earlier drafts, so the **3 starting ghosts are now spread evenly across it** with
  equal margins from each side wall (sprite X = 105/121/137).
- Multi-maze architecture still holds: a maze = a `DATA` grid + a wall color via `GOSUB 800`.
- Draws in a few seconds interpreted; **instant compiled**.

Tunnel wrap is wired for **both** tunnel rows (Ms. Pac-Man's sprite Y = 61 and 109).

## Step 3b — eating, score, win-on-clear
As Ms. Pac-Man's cell-centered (`GOSUB 750`), the cell she's sitting on is checked: a **dot** (10
pts) or **power pellet** (50 pts) is blanked, a short blip plays (`CALL SOUND`), `DOTS` ticks down
from 224, and the HUD (`MAZE 1 DOTS nnn SCORE nnnn`) is redrawn. When `DOTS` reaches **0**,
`MAZE CLEARED!` is shown for 3 seconds and the program ends.

**Step 4:** ghosts start moving (AI) + flicker.

> Architecture note: mazes are authored as plain `#/./o` grids and **autotiled offline** (the
> generator computes each wall's neighbor-mask → tile), so the TI just blits tile codes. The
> readable source grid lives in `DESIGN.md`/the generator; the `.ti99` holds the encoded `DATA`.

## Build & run (Classic99, `JUWEL7` = DSK1)
Same lifecycle that worked for Dot Muncher (`CLAUDE.md` §8). Reminders that bit us before:
- **DSK1 must have "Write DV80 as Windows Text" enabled** (so the assembler can read the
  `RUNTIME*` libraries the compiler's `COPY` pulls in — a DSR error there means it's off).
- **Compiler/assembler output names must be dot-free** (`MSPAC-S`, `MSPAC-O` — never `MSPAC.TXT`).

1. Boot XB256, `NEW`, paste `src/MSPAC.ti99`, `RUN` — verify the Step-1 picture above.
2. `SAVE DSK2.MSPAC` → `SAVE DSK2.MSPAC-M,MERGE`.
3. **COMPILER**: in `MSPAC-M`, out **`MSPAC-S`**, runtime on DSK1, not low memory → Proceed.
4. **ASSEMBLER**: object **`MSPAC-O`** → `0000 ERRORS`.
5. **LOADER**: save **`MSPAC-X`** → `RUN`. Confirm it matches the interpreted run.

> **Note for step 4+ (flicker):** to test flicker *interpreted*, don't paste into a fresh `NEW`
> session — instead `OLD DSK1.HMFLICKER`, then MERGE `MSPAC-M` into it (never `NEW`), so the
> flicker routine stays embedded. Compiled builds get `FLICK` automatically from RUNTIME10.
