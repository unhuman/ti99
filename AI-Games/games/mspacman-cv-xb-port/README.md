# Ms. Pac-Man — CVBasic, faithful 1-shot port of the XB game

A direct CVBasic translation of `games/mspacman/src/MSPAC.ti99` (XB256), as opposed to the
ground-up `games/mspacman-cv` rewrite. The **maze layouts are reused verbatim** (the four `DATA`
strings), and the movement + ghost-AI logic is ported line-for-line.

**Dual target, one source.** The same `mspac.bas` builds for the TI-99/4A *and* the ColecoVision
(shared TMS9918A VDP + SN76489 sound); only the toolchain back end differs:

- **TI-99/4A** (→ `src/mspac_8.bin`, Classic99 / js99er):
  `bash .claude/skills/build-cvbasic-game/build.sh games/mspacman-cv-xb-port/src/mspac.bas "MS PACMAN"`
  (`cvbasic --ti994a` → `xas99` → `linkticart.py`).
- **ColecoVision** (→ `src/mspac.rom`, CoolCV / blueMSX):
  `bash games/mspacman-cv-xb-port/build-coleco.sh`
  (`cvbasic` default target → `gasm80`). Fits Coleco's 1 KB RAM (**209 of 814 bytes**).

## Translation map (XB → CVBasic)
- `M$()` wall cache → the maze is read **straight from VRAM** (`VPEEK` of `scr(r,c)`, `scr` =
  `DEF FN`, VRAM `$1800`); dots are eaten with `VPOKE`. Wall/dot probes call `VPEEK` on demand —
  **no RAM mirror.** (An earlier revision cached the maze in an `mc(768)` RAM array to save VPEEKs;
  that was 768 bytes and, with the `om(768)` openness cache, blew past ColecoVision's 1 KB RAM by
  ~930 bytes. In *compiled* CVBasic a `VPEEK` is a few inline instructions — not the slow
  *interpreted* GCHAR the XB perf doctrine warns about — and the maze is probed only ~10–15×/frame,
  so dropping the mirrors costs almost nothing and lets one source fit both machines.)
- `P$()`/`H$()` openness cache → `om(768)` is gone too; the per-cell openness mask (1=up 2=down
  4=left 8=right passable) is computed **on demand** by `openmask`, which `VPEEK`s the four
  neighbours using the same wall rule the old mask-build loop used (walls 128–143, plus the pen
  exceptions at rows 11–13). The ghost and roaming-fruit direction loops `GOSUB openmask` once per
  decision and bit-test `mk`. Pac-Man stays on `wallchk` (it carries an extra row-13 pen rule the
  ghost mask doesn't).
- `CALL LOCATE/SPRITE` → `SPRITE n, sy-2, sx-1, frame, colour`; TI colour N → CVBasic N-1.
- `::` → `:`; XB block `IF` clauses → CVBasic `IF…THEN`/`END IF`.
- Ghost target distance: XB's `SG*dist` signed-compare → a `flee` flag (max vs min distance);
  squared differences forced to 16-bit so negative diffs don't wrap before squaring.
- Sprite art is the **actual TI art**, converted from the XB `CALL CHAR` quadrant hex
  (TL,BL,TR,BR interleaved to 16×16 rows).

## Known simplifications (not yet faithful)
- **Sound** uses an SFX-duration timer (CVBasic `SOUND` plays until silenced): dot waka, frighten
  warble, descending ghost-eat sweep, fruit chime + roam blip, an eye "pew" on turns, and a 3-voice
  original start jingle (12 chords, melody + harmony + bass) played once when a game begins.
- **Scoring** (HUD appends a `0`, so score = `#pt`×10): dot 10, power pellet 50, ghosts
  200/400/800/1600, fruit 100/200/500/700/1000/2000/5000, extra life at 10000 (three-bell sound).
- **Presentation:** data-driven start tune (`jingle_data`), 1-second "get ready" hold (`ready`)
  after a respawn and after the tune, blinking energizers (char 152 toggled), and a 2-frame ghost
  walk animation (sprite defs 5 and 10, alternated by `#fc`). Game over clears all sprites.
- Sprite draw offset (`sy-2, sx-1`) may need a ±1 tweak after eyeballing on hardware.

## Implemented since the first port
- Per-level **fruit shapes** (cherry…banana) via runtime `DEFINE SPRITE`; **level-clear flash**
  (sprites + sound cleared first); **death spin** animation; **8-3-8** title cheat (LEVEL/LIVES select).
- **Per-maze wall colour** (`setwc` + four `DEFINE COLOR` tables, walls 128–143 and the `+` cross):
  maze 1 magenta, 2 light blue, 3 light red, 4 dark blue — the XB `WC` palette (TI 14/6/10/5 →
  CV 13/5/9/4). Applied in `drawmaze` and restored during the level-clear flash.
- Ghosts: **reverse-on-energizer** (except already-scared), no reverse while scared, no reverse
  while exiting the pen (`gx<>121 AND gy<>77`).
- Ghost speed: distinct **Blinky > Pinky > Inky > Clyde** ranking via per-ghost caps `spc()`
  (Blinky 40≈100%, Pinky 16≈94%, Inky 12≈92%, Clyde 10≈90%); base `sp()` rises +4/level to each cap.
  **Cruise Elroy**: Blinky takes extra move-steps as the maze empties (`dt<30` every other frame,
  `dt<10` every frame), becoming the closer. A level-wide overdrive still boosts all chasers at `le>9`.
- **Timer audit:** every value that exceeds 255 is 16-bit (`#fc #ft #fb #mt #fw`). CVBasic 8-bit
  vars wrap at 256, which silently broke the scatter/chase (`mt=800→32`), fright (`fb=300→44`), and
  fruit-timeout (`fw>400`, never true) timers when ported from XB.

## Cross-platform timing
The main loop is **frame-locked to ~24Hz** (`#pacef`/`pcyc`), measured with a temporary on-screen
loop counter, not guessed. Since 60fps doesn't divide evenly into 24, the loop alternates waiting 2
and 3 VDP frames per step (`pcyc` toggles 0/1, wait threshold `2 + pcyc`) for an average of 2.5
frames/step = 24Hz.

**TI-99 speed was raised, not just capped.** CVBasic compiles every `%` (modulo) — even by a
compile-time-constant power of 2 — to a genuine `DIV` instruction, one of the slowest ops on the
TMS9900; there's no compiler-side conversion to a bitwise AND. The hot path (Pac-Man movement, all
4 ghosts, every tick) did several of these unconditionally, including `#fc % sp(gi)` — a division
by a *runtime variable* (impossible to convert to AND), running up to 3×/tick for the whole game
(the ghost speed throttle). Fixed by: converting every power-of-2 `%` to `AND` (`% 8`→`AND 7`,
`% 16`→`AND 15`, `% 2`→`AND 1`); computing `#fc AND 7`/`#fc AND 1` **once** per tick and reusing
them (was recomputed via `DIV` up to 5×/tick for the identical value — Pac's chomp frame, plus once
per ghost's walk-cycle check); and replacing the variable-divisor ghost speed throttle with a
per-ghost countdown counter (`spcd()`) that reproduces the exact same skip-1-tick-in-`sp(gi)` rate
using only a decrement + compare, no division at all.

Measured effect: the TI-99's native loop rate went from **fluctuating 22–24fps to a solid, stable
24fps** — the same optimization also benefits ColecoVision, which now hits a full uncapped 60fps
(previously not re-measured after this pass). 24Hz remains the shared target since it's the TI's
now-stable ceiling; capping both machines to it keeps the tuned TI feel, sounds included.

## Status
One-shot port; compiles for **both** TI-99/4A (`mspac_8.bin`, 225 RAM bytes) and ColecoVision
(`mspac.rom`, 16 KB, 209 RAM bytes) from one source. TI runtime-tested by the user; the
ColecoVision build needs an emulator pass (keypad 8-3-8, joystick, sound, and Z80 speed with the
per-frame `VPEEK` maze probes). Fixed after first run: real sprite art,
animated title (Pac + ghosts), sprites hidden on title entry/exit (no more game-over pollution),
removed the colour-table poke that corrupted the screen, and corrected collision/AI distance math
(CVBasic 8-bit subtraction wraps — `ABS()` over it and squaring negative diffs were both wrong).
